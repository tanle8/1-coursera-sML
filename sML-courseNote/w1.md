# Terminology
-   `Cost Function`
    In machine learning, the cost function is a function the maps parameters of a model to a number (the cost).
    The cost function measures how well or how badly a model fits the datasets and the objective is often to find a model the describes the data well by picking a model that minimizes some cost function. Examples of common cost functions include the squared error loss (used in linear regression) or the logistic loss (used in logistic regression).
-   `Linear regression`
    Linear regression is a model for modeling the relationship between a numerical variable `y` and one or more explanatory variables (or features) as a linear function.
-   `Regression`
    Regression (or regression analysis) is a statistical process for estimating the relationships among variables.
    Typically, there is an output or dependent variable (such as the price of a house) and one or more predictors or features (such as the area of a house or the number of bedrooms).
    Specifically, regression models estimate how the "typical" value of the output variable changes when one of the features is changed (but the others are fixed constant).
    A common example of regression analysis is linear regression where the dependent variable is modeled as a linear function of the features.
-   `Derivative`
    The derivative of a function measures the sensitivity of the function value with respect to a change in its argument (input value). Intuitively, the derivative tells us how much the function value will change if we change the input values slightly.

-   `Gradient Descent`
    Batch gradient descent, or simply gradient descent, is an iterative optimization algorithm. That is to say, it finds a *local* minimum of a function by repeatedly taking steps proportional to the negative of the gradient (or of the approximate gradient) of the function at the current point. Intuitively you can think of this as repeatedly taking steps in the direction of ***steepest*** descent. If instead one takes steps proportional to the positive of gradient, one approaches a local maximum of that function; the procedure is then known as gradient ascent.

-   `Learning Rate`
    In gradient descent, learning rate refers to parameter that controls how large of a step we should take in the direction of descent.
    When the learning rate is high, we take large steps (big changes to parameter values) and when the learning rate is low we take small steps (small changes to parameter values).
-   `Partial Derivative`
    A partial derivative of a function is its derivative (gradient) with respect to one of its arguments/variables with all other variables kept constant. We can think of the partial derivative as how much we expect the value of a function to change if we make a small change to one of its arguments (leaving the other arguments unchanged).

### Cost Function Intuition
In visual terms, the `training data set` is *scattered* on the `x-y` plane. We are trying to make a ***straight line*** (defined by $h_\theta (x)$) which passes through these scattered data points.

Our `objective` is to get the *best* possible line.
-   The best possible line will be such so that the average squared vertical distances of the scattered points from the line will be the least.
-   Ideally, the line should pass through ***all*** the points of our `training data set`. In such a case, the value of $J(\theta_0, \theta_1)$ will be $0$.

When $\theta_1 = 1$, we get a slope of 1 which goes through every single data point in our model. Conversely, when $\theta_1 = 0.5$, we can see the vertical distance from our fit to the data points increase.
    ![](/image/w1-2-2.png)
This increase our cost function to $0.58$. Plotting several other points yields to the following graph:
    ![](/image/w1-2-3.png)
Thus as a goal, we should try to minimize the cost function. In this case, $\theta_1 = 1$ is our global minimum.

A `contour plot` is  a graph that contains many contour lines.
-   A contour line of a two line of a two variable function has a constant value at all points of the same line.
An example of such a graph is the one to the right below.
    ![](/image/w1-2-4.png)
Taking any color and going along the 'circle', one would expect to get the same value of the cost function.
-   For example, the three green points found on the green line above have the same value for $J(\theta_0, \theta_1)$ and as a result, they are found along the same line.
    The `circled x` displays the real value of the cost function for the graph on the left when $\theta_0 = 800$ and $\theta_1 = -0.15$.
    Taking another $h(x)$ and plotting its contour plot, one gets the following graphs:
    ![](/image/w1-2-5.png)

When $\theta_0 = 360$ and $\theta_1 = 0$, the value of $J(\theta_0, \theta_1)$ in the contour plot gets closer to the center thus reducing the cost function error. Now giving our hypothesis function a slightly positive slope results in a better fit of the data.
    ![](/image/w1-2-6.png)
The graph above minimizes the cost function as much as possible and consequently, the result of $\theta_1$ and $\theta_0$ tend to be around 0.12 and 250 respectively. Plotting those values on our graph to the right seems to put our point in the center of the inner most 'circle'.

## Parameter Learning
### Gradient Descent
So we have our hypothesis function and we have a way of measuring how well it fits into the data. Now we need to ***estimate the parameters*** in the hypothesis function. That's where `gradient descent` comes in.

Imagine that we graph our hypothesis function based on its fields $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ (actually we are graphing the cost function as a function of the parameter estimates). We are not graphing x and y itself, but the parameter range of our hypothesis function and the cost resulting from selecting a particular set of parameters.

We put $\theta_0$ on the `x` axis, and $\theta_1$ on the `y` axis. with the cost function on the vertical `z` axis.
The points on our graph will be the result of the cost function using our hypothesis with those specific theta parameters. The graph below depicts such a setup.
    ![](/image/w1-3-1.png)

We will know that we have succeeded when our cost function is at the *very* bottom of the pits in our graph, i.e. when its value is the minimum. The <span style="color:red">red</span> arrows show the minimum points in the graph.

The way we do this is by taking **derivative** (the tangential line to a function) of our cost function. The slope of the tangent is the derivative at that point and it will give us a direction with the steepest descent. The size of each step is determined by the parameter $\alpha$, which is called the `learning rate`.

-   For example, the distance between each 'star' in the graph above represents a step determined by our parameter $\alpha$.
    -   A *smaller* $\alpha$ would result in a smaller step.
    -   A *larger* $\alpha$ results in a larger step.

The direction in which the step is taken is determined by the **partial derivative** of $J(\theta_0, \theta_1)$. Depending on where one starts on the graph, one could end up at different points. The image above shows us two different starting points that end up in two different places.

The `gradient descent` algorithm is:
>repeat until convergence:
>
>$\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} J(\theta_0, \theta_1)$
> where:
> $j = 0,1$ represents the feature index number.

At *each* iteration j, one should simultaneously update the parameters $\theta_1, \theta_2,...,\theta_n$.
Updating a *specific* parameter prior to calculating another one on the $j^{(th)}$ iteration would yield to a wrong implementation.

### Gradient Descent Intuition
we explored the scenario where we used one parameter $\theta_1$ and plotted its cost function to implement a gradient descent. Our formula for a single parameter was:

>Repeat util convergence:
>
> $\theta_1:=\theta_1-\alpha \frac{d}{d\theta_1} J(\theta_1)$

Regardless of the slope's sign for $\frac{d}{d\theta_1} J(\theta_1)$, $\theta_1$ eventually converges to its minimum value. The following graph shows that when the slopes is negative, the value of $\theta_1$ increases and when it is positive, the value of $\theta_1$ decreases.
