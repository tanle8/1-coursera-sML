# Anomaly Detection
## Terminology
-   `Anomaly Detection`
    Anomaly detection refers to the task of identifying examples in a dataset which are abnormal or do not conform to some expected pattern.

-   `Gaussian Distribution`
    The **Gaussian** (or **Normal**) distribution is a commonly used continuous probability distribution with several important and useful ***properties***.
    Often, the gaussian distribution is used to model quantities that are expected to the sum of many independent contributions because the Central Limit Theorem tells us that such quantities are likely to be nearly normal in many cases.

-   `Probability Distribution`
    A probability distribution is a function that gives the probability of different possible outcomes.

-   `Standard Deviation`
    The standard deviation is a number that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values.
    Intuitively, a quantity with a low standard deviation tends to stick close to its average (or expected value)

-   `Supervised Learning`
    Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a ways to map input signals to output values by training a model on a set of training examples where each example is a pair consisting of an input and a desired output value (the label).

-   `Training Set`
    Training set refers to the set of examples that a model is trained on.
    This is in contrast with the test set which is a set of examples not used to train a model but used to evaluate how well the model will perform on previously unseen examples.
