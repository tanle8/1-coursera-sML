## Collaborative Filtering
-   `Collaborative Filtering`
    Collaborative filtering is a class of approaches used by recommender systems.
    Collaborative filtering refers to methods of predicting the preference of a user for a particular item by collecting preferences from many users.
    The underlying assumption is that if a person A has similar preferences as person B on many items, A is also likely to have a preference similar to B's on an item that B has encountered but A has not.

-   `Feature Vector`
    A feature vector is a vector of numbers that represent properties of an object that we want to use in our prediction or learning task.
    For example, if we want to predict the price of a house using its area and the number of rooms it contains, we would use a 2-dimensional feature vector to represent the house where one dimension would be the area of the house and the second dimension that number of rooms.

-   `Recommender System`
    A recommender system is a system that tries to predict how much a user will like an item in order to find the "best" items to recommend to a user.

-   `Regularization`
    In regression or classification, regularization refers to the process of adding additional terms to our cost function, often to introduce a preference for simpler models. Regularization is often used as a technique to prevent overfitting.
